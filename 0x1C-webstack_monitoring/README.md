### Author: Elaine Yeung [<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23224088/27935507-4e614b68-6260-11e7-8b20-d0352ef3ff53.png" height="18px"/>](https://twitter.com/egsy) 

## Synopsis
This project introduces concept of web stack monitoring, which can be broken down into 2 categories:
* Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
* Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

### At the end of this project students should be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:

- Why do we need monitoring
- What are the 2 types of monitoring
- What is in a web server (such as Nginx) access logs
- What is in a web server error logs
